            <h3>Fire Safety Badge (Brownies)</h3>
            <p>In the second meeting of term we focused on completing the fire safety 
                badge with the Brownies, completing this badge early on in the term was 
                benifacial in a number of aspects as we as the leadership team 
                we could all ensure that we were fully aware and refreshed in where 
                the fire exits were for our meeting room, we also had many new girls 
                join our unit so it was impotant for them to know how to safely exit 
                in an emergency.
                Assisting in a fire drill is also part of the requirements for gaining 
                your assistant leader warrent.</p>

            <h3>Take part in a fire drill at your unit meeting</h3>
            <p>For this requirement we had to get inventive as we could not just pull the 
                fire alarm in the building for the whole building so as we could not 
                find a battery powered fire alarm we were able to find a carbon monoxide 
                detector</p>
            <p>First we talked through with the girls what to do if they hear the sound 
                of a fire alarm [for this instnace in our case a carbon monoxide alarm] which is to 
                stop whatever youare doing listen to the leaders line up quickly and quietly 
                and leave the hall, we also talked with them about what our fire exits 
                are [we have two in our meeting room]{include photo of both exits}</p>
            <p>We then did a practice drill putting the theory to action</p>
            <p>at a random time during the meeting we then sounded the alarm, we 
                did this at ranodm as it would siulate a reall evcuation.</p>
            <p>We then ensured that we had all the girls and all adults evacuated 
                completing a head cound once we assembled at the assembly point 
                {include photo of assembly point}</p>

        <section>
            <h3>State how to call the Fire Brigade</h3>

            <p>For this we first talked to the girls about the importance of calling the 
                emergency services when htey are needed, after that we went through the 
                numbers that are needed to call them <strong><i>999/112</i></strong> 
                and we also told them that you can call <i>112</i> in all of the <strong>EU</strong>
